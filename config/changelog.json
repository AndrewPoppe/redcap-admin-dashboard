    "notes": "This update adds a new report type, 'Project Join', as an alternative to the standard 'SQL Query'. This feature allows one REDCap project to be \"joined\" with another, so that the resulting report contains data from both projects in one table. This feature was designed with a simple use case in mind and will likely not play nice with repeating instruments or longitudinal projects.",

      "Added new 'Project Join' report type",
      "Fixed issue with Export option not appearing for Executive users despite being enabled."
